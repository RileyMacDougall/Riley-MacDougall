## About me
I'm someone who loves staying active and enjoys the outdoors. I'm a big fan of hockey whether it's watching the game or hitting the ice myself. I value time with friends, have a soft spot for dogs, and enjoy relaxing days out fishing. Whether it's a quiet morning by the water or cheering for the leafs, I'm all about good vibes and great company.
